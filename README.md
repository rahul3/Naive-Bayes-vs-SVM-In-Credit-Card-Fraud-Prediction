# Naive-Bayes-vs-SVM-In-Credit-Card-Fraud-Prediction

An analysis of the possible application of Machine Learning to fraud prediction techniques in the credit card industry. This was a paper for a project during my Masters in Computer Sc. at the University of South Florida. A coarse grid search was performed for hyper-parameters of the Naive Bayes classifier vs SVM for credit card fraud prediciton.
